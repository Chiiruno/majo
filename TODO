General structure
Separate process for functionality if requires non-project process (IE: postgres, ffmpeg)
Mainly server, p2p fallback/where appropriate
Application and browser client
Many programs working together for application server/client
WASM web client is monolithic?
Consider C or Rust for high throughput sub-applications (maybe just make it straight from C for shits and giggles?)
or just V
Git-like system for all modifications by client to server (easy reverse, go back to $REVISION$)
counter/colored text options for board owner to set instead of static pyu/red/blue
