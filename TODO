General structure
Mainly server, p2p fallback/where appropriate
Application and browser client
Git-like system for all modifications by client to server (easy reverse, go back to $REVISION$)
Counter/colored text options for board owner to set instead of static pyu/red/blue
Module background/foreground paired processes with UNIX sockets
Possibly multi-server synced/shared pairs (cache server 1, cache server 2, etc)
